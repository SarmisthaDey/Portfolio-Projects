# Portfolio-Projects

This repository is about all the projects that I have done through upskilling and self-learning process.

It mainly consists of projects related to Data Analysis, Data cleaning, Data exploration, Queries used for Data visualizations, Web scrapping through Python with the help of BeautifulSoup library. 

**Language/Software used:** SQL, Python, Excel, Jupyter Notebook, SSMS

# SQL
I used MSSQL Server to complete the SQL projects. This repository consists of data cleaning and data exploration projects using SQL. Skills used in these two projects are DDL and DML query, Joins, CTE's (Common Table Expressions), Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, Converting Data Types. 

# Excel
For the Excel Full Project, I created a dashboard on coffee sales and you can see the output below for reference. I plan to work on creating a different or expanding on this dashboard to test my skills in the future. Few functions that I used for preparing the data and creating this dashboard are XLOOKUP, INDEX, MATCH, IF function, date formatting, number formatting, duplicate removal, range to table creation, pivot table, pivot chart(line chart, column chart), filter and slicer.

# Power BI
Studies show that Human brain process visuals 60,000 times faster than text. Sharing insights to the stakeholders through Data Visualization can be very powerful for any Data Analysis project. Here's my Power BI Dashboard for project on COVID 19. In this project, I created a dashboard to analyse data on Covid 19 total cases, total death, death percentage, death by continent, world map with percentage population infected by continent and country, top 5 countries with percentage infection. I have transformed the data in power query editor after loading, removed rows with null continent, replaced null values with 0 in numerical column, changed data type, created new measure using DAX to use in visualisation. I plan to make use of Power BI again to make my own visualisations and dashboard.

# Python
For the Python Projects, I have used Jupyter Notebook. This folder consists of project on data scraping using BeautifulSoup library, Movie correlation project using Pandas, Numpy for working with numerical values for mathematical function and data analysis, Matplotlib, Seaborn libraries for data visualisations. Below is a correlation matrix data visualisation I created to show the relation between different features of the movie dataset.
